            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>F²LAMEA is a father-driven family advocacy movement originating in South Africa, born from a critical examination of the discriminatory Children's Act and the biased family courts that rob children of their fathers and paternal families by discriminating against fathers. We are dedicated to challenging and dismantling discriminatory practices that undermine parental rights and family unity, with a particular focus on achieving true equality before the law for both parents, regardless of gender or race.</p>
            <p>Our advocacy is rooted in the fundamental belief that children have an inherent right to meaningful relationships with both parents and their extended paternal family. We challenge systemic biases that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marginalize fathers in legal proceedings</li>
                <li>Create unequal access to parental rights and responsibilities</li>
                <li>Perpetuate legal frameworks that systematically separate children from their fathers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>F²LAMEA is committed to exposing and rectifying discriminatory practices within family courts and legal systems that undermine the essential role of fathers in their children's lives. We strive to ensure that the best interests of children are truly served by recognizing and protecting the vital connections between children, their fathers, and paternal families.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
            <p>F²LAMEA envisions a world where every child thrives in the care and support of their entire family, including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, free from the damaging effects of discrimination. We strive for a society where family courts and related systems prioritise the well-being of children above all else, ensuring that their voices are heard, their needs are met, and their right to a loving relationship with both parents and extended family is protected.</p>

    <section class="about-values">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Core Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equality:</strong> We believe in the equality before the law of all individuals and strive to ensure equal treatment for all parents and family members within family courts and related systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> We hold individuals, institutions, and governments accountable for upholding the principles of equality and non-discrimination.</li>
                <li><strong>Justice:</strong> We seek to achieve justice for families and children who have been harmed by discriminatory practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We believe in the power of collaboration and work with diverse partners to achieve our goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence-Based Advocacy:</strong> We base our advocacy on rigorous research and data to ensure that our efforts are effective and impactful.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Unity:</strong> We recognize the extended family as a fundamental pillar of support, strength, and cultural identity for children, and we advocate for policies and practices that preserve and strengthen these bonds.</li>
