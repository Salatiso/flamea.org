            <h2>About F²LAMEA</h2>
            <p>F²LAMEA is a father-driven family advocacy movement originating in South Africa, born from a critical examination of the discriminatory Children’s Act and the biased family courts that marginalize fathers. We are dedicated to challenging and dismantling practices that undermine parental rights and family unity, with a core focus on achieving true equality before the law for all parents, regardless of gender or race.</p>
            <p>Founded by Salatiso Lonwabo Mdeni, F²LAMEA reflects a personal commitment to justice, sparked by his own experiences and documented in works like <em>The Homeschooling Father</em>, <em>Goliath’s Reckoning</em>, and <em>Beyond Redress</em>.</p>
